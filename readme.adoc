This guide contains practical material for the tutorial _Multi-Agent Oriented Programming_ at https://easss23.fit.cvut.cz[23rd European Agent Systems Summer] School, 2023, Prague.


= Scenario

(SmartRoom)

initially we consider one agent in a room ....

= JaCaMo Setup (Lab 1)

The simplest way to run the examples and do the exercises is by using https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jomifred/easss-23[GitPod, following this link] (a github account is required).

To run the initial project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd hello-world
./gradlew
----


= Agent Dimension (Lab 1)

Activities and Exercises (ideas)

----
cd ag-smart-room1
./gradlew
----


(after introduction to agent and execution)

- change the preferred temperature

- [add wait to avoid busy waiting; what are the problem, could the wait of 10 minutes? how to solve? point to doc of wait and wait for an event]

- [add a plan to print the state of the HVAC]
  [if "off" print "turned of", if "on" print "turned on"]
  [enforce unification instead of if]

- [create a plan to stop and use jason cli to trigger it -- difficult without REPL]

- [another implementation with !temperature(XX) goal that works; then add two goals; [give the code for that]; exercise is to understand the code, the agent behaviour and explain the problem]

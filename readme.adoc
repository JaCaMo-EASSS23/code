This guide contains practical material for the tutorial _Multi-Agent Oriented Programming_ at https://easss23.fit.cvut.cz[23rd European Agent Systems Summer] School, 2023, Prague.


== Smart Room Scenario

The objective is to develop an MAOP system to control the temperature of a room so that it reaches some desired temperature

* The room is equipped with a "Heating, Ventilating and Air  Conditioning" (HVAC), that provides

** the current room temperature
** operations to start cooling, start heating, and stop the machine

* initially we have one agent that has the goal of maintaining a certain temperature

== Agent Dimension (Lab 1)

=== Task 1: run the initial project for the smart room scenario

The simplest way to run the examples and do the exercises is by using https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/JaCaMo-EASSS23/code[GitPod, following this link] (a github account is required). You can also work locally by cloning this repository (https://github.com/JaCaMo-EASSS23/code). Java and VSCode should be installed in this case.

To run the initial project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd lab1/smart-room-sa
./gradlew
----

You can see how the system reacts to changes in temperature by opening another terminal and executing the command:

----
curl -X POST  http://localhost:8080/workspaces/room/artifacts/hvac/properties/temperature -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[ 10 ]'
----

replacing the last number 10 by the current temperature of the room.


=== Task 2: Reading and understanding agent programs

* Exercise 1: open the code of the room controller agent (file `src/agt/room_controller.asl`), read the code and identify the beliefs, goals, and plans. Try to map the program to the observed behavior. 

* Exercise 2: open the _mind inspector_ for agent `rc` and compare the beliefs there with those identified in the program. Are they the same? Are they represented the same way? 

* Exercise 3: change the program so that the target temperature is 15.

=== Task 3: Improve the implementation

* Exercise 4: add a new plan to print the current state of the HVAC.

* Exercise 5: change the plans of the previous exercise so that when the hvac state is `"cooling"` it is printed "so cool" and, when the state is `"heating"` it is printed "so hot".

* Exercise 6: open the project in folder `lab1/e6` and take a look at the room controller program. There is a difference in the last lines (line 17). Evaluate the reasons for that modification and its problems. Some ideas about how to fix?

* Exercise 7: open the project in folder `lab1/e7` and take a look at the room controller program. The target temperature is as an argument of goal `keep_temperature`. The project, as it is, works. But what happens if a line like `!keep_temperature(35)` is added in the program? Explain the behavior produced buy this change.


== Agent Communication (Lab 2)

=== Task 1: experiment different performatives

* Exercise 1: open the project `lab2/e1`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the two agents, and execute the application. Now change the plan of Bob to:
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, tell, hello);
      .send(alice, tell, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. Now change the plan again to
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, signal, hello);
      .send(alice, signal, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. 

* Exercise 2: open the project `lab2/e2`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the three agents, and execute the application. Use the mind inspector to see the beliefs of the agents (specially Alice). Now change the plan of Alice to:
+
----
+!start
   <- .wait(500);
      .send(karlos, askOne, vl(_), vl(X));
      .println(X).
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. 

* Exercise 3: open the project `lab2/e3`, read the program of the three agents, and execute the application. List the sequence of exchanged messages and their performatives. Finally, use the mind inspector "link of plans" (in the bottom of the page) to see the plans of Alice.


=== Task 2: Improve the project for the voting protocol

You can run the project with the following commands:
----
cd lab2/smart-room-ma
./gradlew
----

* Exercise 4: change the list of options offered to the personal assistants. 

* Exercise 5: run the voting protocol twice, with two different options and notice possible problems.

* Exercise 6: currently, the `id` of the conversation is fixed to 1, this may cause problems when counting the votes. Change the program of the room controller so that the identification is a parameter for the goal `voting`.

* Exercise 7: upgrade the previous version so that the conversation id value is incremented each time a voting protocol is executed.

* Exercise 8: add a new personal assistant. Does the application works properly? The rule `all_votes_received` is hard-coded for 3 participants. How to make it flexible? Think about possible solutions. Hints: see the internal actions link:https://jason.sourceforge.net/api/jason/stdlib/all_names.html[`.all_names`] and link:https://jason.sourceforge.net/api/jason/stdlib/df_register.html[`.df_register`].


== Environment Dimension (Lab 3)

=== Task 1: Implement a usage interface for the voting machine
- [define observable property `status` (with values `open`/`closed`) in the artifact's `init` method]
- [implement operations for: `open`, `vote`, and `close`]

=== Task 2: Instantiate and use a voting machine
- [complete plan(s) for creating, starting, and stopping the voting machine]
- [complete plan(s) for focusing on the voting machine and bidding]

=== Task 3: Implement automatic closing with a countdown
- [implement an internal operation for closing the voting machine with a countdown]

== Organisation Dimension (Lab 4)

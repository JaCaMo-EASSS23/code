This guide contains practical material for the tutorial _Multi-Agent Oriented Programming_ at https://easss23.fit.cvut.cz[23rd European Agent Systems Summer] School, 2023, Prague.


== Smart Room Scenario

The objective is to develop an MAOP system to control the temperature of a room so that it reaches some desired temperature

* The room is equipped with a "Heating, Ventilating and Air  Conditioning" (HVAC), that provides

** the current room temperature
** operations to start cooling, start heating, and stop the machine

* initially we have one agent that has the goal of maintaining a certain temperature

== Agent Dimension (Lab 1)

=== Task 1: Run the initial project for the smart room scenario

The simplest way to run the examples and do the exercises is by using https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/JaCaMo-EASSS23/code[GitPod, following this link] (a github account is required). You can also work locally by cloning this repository (https://github.com/JaCaMo-EASSS23/code). Java JDK 17+ and VSCode should be installed locally in this case.

To run the initial project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd lab1/smart-room-sa
./gradlew
----

You can see how the system reacts to changes in temperature by opening another terminal and executing the command:

----
curl -X POST  http://localhost:8080/workspaces/room/artifacts/hvac/properties/temperature -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[ 10 ]'
----

replacing the last number 10 by the current temperature of the room.


=== Task 2: Reading and understanding agent programs

* Exercise 1: open the code of the room controller agent (file `src/agt/room_controller.asl`), read the code and identify the beliefs, goals, and plans. Try to map the program to the observed behavior.

* Exercise 2: open the _mind inspector_ for agent `rc` and compare the beliefs there with those identified in the program. Are they the same? Are represented the same way? 

* Exercise 3: change the program so that the target temperature is 15.

=== Task 3: Improve the implementation

* Exercise 4: add a new plan to print the current state of the HVAC.

* Exercise 5: change the plans of previous exercise so that when the hvac state is `"cooling"` it is printed "so cool" and, when the state is `"heating"` it is printed "so hot".

* Exercise 6: open the project in folder `lab1/e6` and take a look at the room controller program. There is a difference in the last lines (line 17). Evaluate the reasons for that modification and its problems. Some ideas about how to fix? (no need to develop the solution in Jason.)

* Exercise 7: open the project in folder `lab1/e7` and take a look at the room controller program. The target temperature is as an argument of goal `keep_temperature`. The project, as it is, works. But what happens if a line like `!keep_temperature(35)` is added in the program? Explain the behavior produced by this change.


== Agent Communication (Lab 2)

=== Task 1: Experiment different performatives

* open the project `lab2/e1`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the two agents, and execute the application. Now change the plan of bob to:
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, tell, hello);
      .send(alice, tell, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. Now change the plan again to
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, signal, hello);
      .send(alice, signal, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference.

* open the project `lab2/e2`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the three agents, and execute the application. Use the mind inspector to see the beliefs of the agents. Now change the plan of alice to:
+
----
+!start
   <- .wait(500);
      .send(karlos, askOne, vl(_), vl(X));
      .println(X).
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. 



=== Task 2: Run the project for the voting protocol

To run the project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd lab2/smart-room-ma
./gradlew
----

- example of askOne sync and async

- [case of many source and belief removal]

- [case of source of sources]

- [increment id]

- [use DF to find participants]


== Environment Dimension (Lab 3)

=== Task 1: Implement a usage interface for the voting machine
- [define observable property `status` (with values `open`/`closed`) in the artifact's `init` method]
- [implement operations for: `open`, `vote`, and `close`]

=== Task 2: Instantiate and use a voting machine
- [complete plan(s) for creating, starting, and stopping the voting machine]
- [complete plan(s) for focusing on the voting machine and bidding]

=== Task 3: Implement automatic closing with a countdown
- [implement an internal operation for closing the voting machine with a countdown]

== Organization Dimension (Lab 4)

=== Task 1: Reading and understanding an organization

* Exercise 1: in this project the purpose is to coordinate the actions of agents when posting on a forum. There are two agents alice and bob; alice is responsible for posting a message and bob for retrieving the post. Open the project `lab4/e1`, read the `.jcm` file and the agents' program, and execute the application. Explain why is the displayed `Received message` content is empty? What does happen if `<- .wait(2000) ; retrievePost(-1) ;` replaces of line 7 in `src/agt/forum_agents.asl`?

* Exercise 2: open the project `lab4/e2`, read the XML organization specification and identify the organization roles, goals, missions and norms. Execute the application. open the _organization inspector_ (http://localhost:3171) and verify the state of the agents' goals. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the organization approach to coordination?

* Exercise 3: comment out the lines 15-21 in `src/agt/forum_agents` and execute the application. Use the _organization inspector_ to verify why the application does not execute properly. Hint: Look at the msg_vacation scheme.

=== Task 2: Changing the organization

=== Task 3: Agents deploying their organization
